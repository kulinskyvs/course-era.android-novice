    <string name="description.Linus_Torvalds">
        This Finnish/American engineer graduated from the University of Helsinki, and then invented a Unix
        operating system flavor which became Linux, one of the most widely used operating systems in the world.
        Linux hasnâ€™t seen much growth in the consumer market, but has been a mainstay for programmers for decades.
        Most of the internet runs on Linux servers, the trademark of which is incredible stability,
        and strong security. Torvalds continues his work, sponsored by the Linux foundation,
        and his continued contributions to the Linux platform have continued to change computing for everybody,
        albeit behind the scenes.</string>
